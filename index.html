<H1>  The Los Angeles Lakers</H1>
<H3><i> The Past: </i>
The team was founded in 1947 and were originally located in Minneapolis.
They won 5 of their 16 National Championship titles after the NBA's formation in 1949.
Los Angeles made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost each series to the Boston Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry.
The team acquired another center, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won multiple MVP awards, but was unable to make the Finals in the late 1970s. 
The 1980s Lakers were nicknamed "Showtime" due to their Magic Johnson-led fast break-offense, and won five championships in a 9-year span, including their first ever Finals championship against the Celtics in 1985.

After Abdul-Jabbar’s retirement in 1989 and Johnson’s in 1991, the Lakers’ fortunes took a turn for the worse. The team still regularly made the play-offs—the Lakers missed postseason play only five times in the team’s first 60 seasons—but failed to advance to the NBA finals for the longest period of time in team history. That changed during the 1999–2000 season, however, when newly 
hired head coach Phil Jackson guided the Lakers, featuring Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant, to the first of three consecutive titles.</H4> </blockquote>
